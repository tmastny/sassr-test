DEPRECATION WARNING on line 1 of /sass/spec/output_styles/nested/libsass-issues/issue_948/input.scss: #{} interpolation near operators will be simplified
in a future version of Sass. To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote("#{10 * 5}px")

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
