DEPRECATION WARNING on line 6 of /sass/spec/output_styles/compressed/libsass-issues/issue_1333/input.scss: #{} interpolation near operators will be simplified
in a future version of Sass. To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote('#{baz()}" !important"')

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
