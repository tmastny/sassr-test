DEPRECATION WARNING on line 4 of /sass/spec/output_styles/compressed/libsass/interpolated-function-call/input.scss: #{} interpolation near operators will be simplified
in a future version of Sass. To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote("#{$f}#{a, 1 + 2, c}")

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
